First, compile the file using SWI Prolog or Using Docker on Visual Studio.

Enter "run." as the command in order to start the "Ma'arechet Mumche" who can parse sentences and using our defined predicats, return appropriate answers.

Once in the run you may ask for example: "who married victoria" (without the qutotaion marks) and the answer should return as "albert".
The same will go for the question: "who married albert" and the answer will return as victoria.

Another type of question you ask is a boolean type of question such as: "is philip a parent" and the answer will return as "yes".

If a wrong relation in the question is asked such as "who married max" (with max not being in the defined database of monarchs), the answer will return as "too difficult".
In case a wrong relation is in a boolean type of question, such as "is max a parent", the answer will return as "no".

There are many other questions that can be asked, regarding birth and death years, gender and different family relations for example.

If you want to exit the stream run the press "stop" and then press enter.
Once back in the main Prolog part you can ask regular questions such as "nephew(X,Y)." and get the list of possible answers.
You may also find out who is in the line of succession as heir to the throne by typing "eldest_person(H)." and get the answer as charles with his birth year.
