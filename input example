First, compile the file using SWI Prolog or Using Docker on Visual Studio.
Enter "run." as the command in order to start the "Ma'arechet Mumche" who can parse sentences and using our defined predicats, return appropriate answers.
Once in the run you may ask for example: "who married victoria" (without the qutotaion marks) and the answer should return as "albert".
The same will go for the question: "who married albert" and the answer will return as victoria.
Another type of question you ask is a boolean type of question such as: "is philip a parent" and the answer will return as yes.
If a wrong relation in the question is asked such as "who married mx" (with Max not being in the defined database of monarchs), the answer will return as "too difficult".
In case a wrong relation is in a boolean type of question, such as "is max a parent"
